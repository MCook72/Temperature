# Temperature
During the height of COVID concerns, I was working in the office, but temperature testing twice a day.  
I kept a record of that testing to understand more about my body, 
What would be an abnormal temperature (Null hypothesis: my temperature is normal; alternative hypothesis: I have a fever) - what temperature would allow me to reject the null hypothesis
How does my temperature varies (should I reject the null hypothesis with a different temperature a different times of the day or days of the week?)
